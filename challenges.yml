        Everything in a PHP file is just HTML code at first. If you want
        to write some dynamic PHP code, you'll activate PHP mode by always
        writing this first:
    explanation: >    
        As soon as you write `<?php` you are in PHP mode. So, `<?php echo 'Hello'; ?>`
        gets you into PHP mode and executes `echo 'Hello'`. The `?>` gets
        you *out* of PHP mode, and back into normal HTML land.

        What's the job of the `echo` statement?
    explanation: >
        `echo` - as in `echo 'this question was no problem';` - is used to print anything
        out. There are a few other ways to print stuff, but `echo` is by far the most important.
        You rock `echo`!

        The management of AirPupNMeow is always changing its mind. To simplify
        the life of our devs, let's use a variable so that when management
        changes the tag line, we only have to update one spot. Create
        a variable called `airpupTag` and set it to the `I luv puppies` text. Then
        print this inside the `<h2>` tag.

        Poor devs. Management was so excited about variables that they

        It's hard to keep track of how many loveable pets we have

        Clearly the dev team has been drinking too much Red Bull.

        Think about the order that things happen:
        #. `SQUIRREL!` is passed to `strtolower` and becomes `squirrel!`.
        #. `squirrel!` is passed to `strrev` and becomes `!lerriuqs`.
        #. Finally, the `ri` in `!lerriuqs` is replaced with `aa`, giving us `!leraauqs`.
