        Everything in a PHP file is just HTML code at first. If you want
        to write some dynamic PHP code, you'll activate PHP mode by always
        writing this first:
    explanation: >    
        As soon as you write `<?php` you are in PHP mode. So, `<?php echo 'Hello'; ?>`
        gets you into PHP mode and executes `echo 'Hello'`. The `?>` gets
        you *out* of PHP mode, and back into normal HTML land.

        AirPupNMeow needs you to create their site! It's a humble beginning.
        Start by opening PHP, then echo their tag line: "I luv puppies"

        What's the job of the `echo` statement?
    explanation: >
        `echo` - as in `echo 'this question was no problem';` - is used to print anything
        out. There are a few other ways to print stuff, but `echo` is by far the most important.
        You rock `echo`!

        The management of AirPupNMeow is always changing its mind. To simplify
        the life of our devs, let's use a variable so that when management
        changes the tag line, we only have to update one spot. Create
        a variable called `airpupTag` and set it to the `I luv puppies` text. Then
        print this inside the `<h2>` tag.

        Poor devs. Management was so excited about variables that they
        tried to edit the code themselves. We've sent the dev team for
        ice cream to make up for it. While they're gone, fix the errors
        in this file for them.
