        Everything in a PHP file is just HTML code at first. If you want
        to write some dynamic PHP code, you'll activate PHP mode by always
        writing this first:
    explanation: >    
        As soon as you write `<?php` you are in PHP mode. So, `<?php echo 'Hello'; ?>`
        gets you into PHP mode and executes `echo 'Hello'`. The `?>` gets
        you *out* of PHP mode, and back into normal HTML land.
